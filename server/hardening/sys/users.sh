# Main Logic
#
# Delete users flagged as to be deleted.
# Delete passwords of users flagged to have their password removed.
# Lock users flagged to be locked.
# Prompt to change the shell for users flagged to be reshelled.
# Prompt to change the UID of users flagged to be reUIDed.
# Promot to change the primary & supplementary groups of users flagged to be regrouped.
